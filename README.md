This project focused on cleaning and analyzing TTC subway delay data to uncover patterns and insights into service disruptions.

üìä Key Contributions:

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
I populated missing values by extrapolating information from other attributes like Line and Station. For values that I could not extrapolate, I removed the entire row from the dataset. 


, standardized delay categories, and removed inconsistencies for a high-quality dataset.







Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends in delay frequency, duration, and common causes using visualizations and statistical analysis.
Insightful Visualizations: Created charts and graphs to highlight peak delay periods, station-specific disruptions, and seasonal trends.

üîç Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Geopandas, Scipy

This project showcased my skills in data wrangling and exploratory analysis to support data-driven decision-making.
