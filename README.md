This project focused on cleaning and analyzing TTC subway delay data to uncover patterns and insights into service disruptions.

📊 Key Contributions:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized delay categories, and removed inconsistencies for a high-quality dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends in delay frequency, duration, and common causes using visualizations and statistical analysis.
Insightful Visualizations: Created charts and graphs to highlight peak delay periods, station-specific disruptions, and seasonal trends.

🔍 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project showcased my skills in data wrangling and exploratory analysis to support data-driven decision-making.
